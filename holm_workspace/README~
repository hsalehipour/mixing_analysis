% This is a rather automated code to analyse the data;
% Multiple notes to which one should pay attention:
%   1) Make sure the data.in file contains the correct path to your desired
%      cases 
%   2) In each path, there should exist (i)   siminfo.dat file
%                                       (ii)  FILE.LIST
%                                       (iii) stat2d.dat
%                                       (iv)  stat3d.dat
%   3) FILE.LIST has to include number of h*.dat files and their absolute
%      paths
%
%   4) All the neccessary analysis should be performed inside AnalyseData.m
%   5) All the ploting commands should be invoked inside PlotData.m
